Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

## Notes
Great job on this project! Most of my JavaScript critiques are nit-picky
and are easy to work through. The interfaces will get easier, potentially add custom styling to your dropdown selector and input forms. Most of my feedback is inline in the project.

## Things you'd like specific feedback on:
I would like to get a feed back on how my js coding is and how much more can i refactor the code.
I addressed this mainly in the JS file, but just be consistent! I would also focus on trying ES6 classes or maybe shorter functions. 

Also if its easy for everyone to read. had a tough time adding meaningful id class and variables.
This is also addressed mostly inline, the variable names are pretty clear to me other than where I specifically addressed it. Your function names are very clear.
